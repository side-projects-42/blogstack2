    ## About


    [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guner-046199128/add-edit/SUMMARY/?profileFormEntryPoint=PROFILE_SECTION&trackingId=LeUnT7fXQYKAZmMp8EatZw%3D%3D)


    Web Developer and Electrical Engineer.\

    I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in electrical engineering from TCNJ and a web development certification from Lambda School, and I am an exceedingly creative and passionate engineer. I genuinely enjoy and excel in a collaborative environment. I often assume a hybrid role between creative design and leadership. I have a tendency to become deeply entrenched in my work when left to my own devices but I am perfectly adaptable to a host of different leadership styles.
