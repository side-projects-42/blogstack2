# The 25 Best Widgets To Include On Small Business Websites

[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/cc407b53/dms3rep/multi/opt/Widgets+post-1920w.jpg)](<>)

Widgets are highly useful tools for building websites at scale. Essentially, website widgets are individual site elements that can either be dragged and dropped onto a web page or added by cutting and pasting a bit of code. 

There are many different types of website widgets out there. Widgets can be used to add design elements to a page, improve usability and functionality, and integrate third-party tools and applications. Using a tool like Duda’s [custom widget builder](https://www.duda.co/developers/widget-builder), you can even create your own.

## 1. TEXT WIDGET

[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/cc407b53/dms3rep/multi/opt/text+widget+-1920w.png)](<>)

Somewhat obviously, text is one of the basic building blocks of the web. Using text widgets on your website enables you to quickly add copy to a web page and easily manage aspects like font type and size, text style (e.g., header), text color and more.

## 2. IMAGE WIDGET

[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/cc407b53/dms3rep/multi/opt/image+widget+-1920w.png)](<>)

Image widgets can be found on pretty much every small business site across the web. Very few web pages today make use of text only. However, just because image widgets are common doesn't mean they can't be deployed in interesting ways. If you can successfully work image widgets into your digital storytelling, you're much more likely to turn visitors into customers.

## 3. BEFORE & AFTER WIDGET

BeforeAfter

People have short attention spans on the web and you want to convey messages quickly. Before and after widgets can be used to tell a whole story in an instant and will definitely be a big hit on any site you create. Plus, the slider on the image is very fun to play with.

## 4. CALENDAR WIDGET

[![](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/cc407b53/dms3rep/multi/opt/calendar+widget+-1920w.png)](<>)

A calendar website widget is easy-to-understand and visually engaging way of letting site visitors know what is on a business or organization's schedule. For example, a yoga studio may use a calendar widget to display upcoming classes on a homepage.

## 5. CLICK TO CALL WIDGET

[Call Us ](<>)

Most small business owners look forward to calls from potential customers, so it should be a top priority to facilitate as many as possible from the website. Click to call widgets usually take the form of big, thumb-friendly buttons that enable a visitor to call a business in just one click. This widget is great at getting attention and driving customer leads.

## 6. SHARE WIDGET

   [](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20great%20website%20with%20you%20https%3A%2F%2Fblog.duda.co%2Fbest-website-widgets) [](mailto:?subject=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20great%20website%20with%20you&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.duda.co%2Fbest-website-widgets)

Word of mouthing is often thought of as the best form of marketing. On the web, sharing is how we facilitate it. Share widgets enable customers to easily tell other consumers about the cool product or service that are offered on the website. Almost every web page you build should have a share widget included on it.

## 7. COUNTDOWN WIDGET﻿

Most businesses keep some form of regular opening hours. You want to display these clearly on any small business website you create, especially if the business maintains a physical location where customers might show up. The homepage is an excellent location for a business hours widget.

## 9. LOTTIE ANIMATION WIDGET

Lottie animations are sleek, flexible vector animations that load quickly and look fantastic on all devices.

* Lottie animations are vectors that fit any screen size and device type. This means no pixelations, regardless of size.
* Lottie animations are exported as JSON files, so they load quickly and won’t slow down your sites.
* You can change the color of the animation directly in the Lottie editor, enabling you to give it the right look and feel for your site.

Lists are one of the most common ways people format content on the web. List widgets provide web designers and digital marketers with an easy way to present a list of information in a beautiful design. List widgets are commonly used to display everything from business locations to services and employee profiles.

## 17. TABLE WIDGET

In a way, table widgets are similar to list widgets. They are used to organize and display a large amount of information in a succinct way. However, the design of a table on a web page is usually quite different from that of a list. A table widget makes it easy to create a table that will display properly on desktop, tablet and mobile. Many of these widgets will also enable you to create a table simply by connecting a spreadsheet of some kind. 

## 18. [WEATHER MONITOR WIDGET](https://www.new-widget-workshop.thecamel.co/weather-monitor)

For businesses and organizations with large staffs (e.g., schools, gyms, medical offices, etc.), a list widget might not be the most scalable option and a table widget may lack the full design capabilities you need to create engaging profiles. In this case, a staff directory widget is the ideal tool to deploy. Using this advanced widget, you can build out rich employee profiles that are easy to navigate and search.
