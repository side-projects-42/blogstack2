To find out, you'll first need to start up your site's local development server.</p>\n<p>The <strong>development server</strong> is a useful tool for when you're working on your site locally (from your own computer). When your development server is running, you can use a web browser to interact with your local copy of your site. That way, you can test out changes to your code, to make sure they work before you actually publish a new version of your site to the internet.</p>\n<p>To start up your development server, do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the command line, change into the directory you created for your site:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>~/Desktop</p>\n<p>Copy~/Desktop: copy code to clipboard`</p>\n<p>cd my-first-gatsby-site</p>\n<p>`</p>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Whenever you want to run any commands for your site, you need to be in the context for that site. That is, your command line needs to be pointed at the directory where your site's code lives.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From your site directory, start the development server by running the following command:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>~/Desktop/my-first-gatsby-site</p>\n<p>Copy~/Desktop/my-first-gatsby-site: copy code to clipboard`</p>\n<p>gatsby develop</p>\n<p>`</p>\n<p>If you weren't able to install the Gatsby command line interface globally, you can start your development server using the following command instead:</p>\n<p>Copycopy code to clipboard`</p>\n<p>npm run develop</p>\n<p>`</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After a few moments, the command line should output a message like the following, telling you your development server is ready to go!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Copycopy code to clipboard`</p>\n<p>You can now view my-first-gatsby-site in the browser.</p>\n<p>‚†Ä</p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/\">http://localhost:8000/</a></p>\n<p>‚†Ä</p>\n<p>View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and</p>\n<p>schema</p>\n<p>‚†Ä</p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/___graphql\">http://localhost:8000/___graphql</a></p>\n<p>`</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your favorite web browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/static/b79cb66545b144295a8c6a5efeaafb20/94cea/localhost-new-site.png\">![The default home page generated by the \"gatsby new\" command.](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/static/b79cb66545b144295a8c6a5efeaafb20/321ea/localhost-new-site.png \"The default home page generated by the \"gatsby new\" command.\")</a></p>\n<p>And there it is: your very first Gatsby site! üéâ</p>\n<p>You'll be able to visit the site locally at <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> for as long as your development server is running.

To stop running that process (or to \"stop running the development server\"), go back to your terminal window, hold down the \"control\" key, and then hit \"c\" (<code>ctrl-c</code>). To start it again, run <code>gatsby develop</code> again!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using VM setup like vagrant and/or would like to listen on your local IP address, run <code>gatsby develop --host=0.0.0.0</code>.
