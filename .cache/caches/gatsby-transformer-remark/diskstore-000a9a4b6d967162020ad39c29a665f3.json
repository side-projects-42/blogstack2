These people write the code that gets a website working and visible on the world wide web.</p>\n<p>The primary task of a web developer is to write code, which is a set of commands and instructions written in a particular programming language. Code makes up everything in the online world, from your computer‚Äôs operating system to the backend of a website you visit.</p>\n<p>Take a look at Wikipedia‚Äôs homepage and imagine what it might take to create even such a simple website. A web developer set up the layout of this page, from the sidebar to the tables to the top bar. They had to set up scripts to take blurbs from the featured articles and request dynamic content from the site.</p>\n<p>A database stores these articles and their revisions, also set up by a developer.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia homepage</p>\n<p>It takes a ton of work, but everything comes together piece by piece to create a functional website.</p>\n<p>With the exponential rise of the internet, programmers are in high demand and have a great job outlook. Everyone wants to have their website, and web developers are here to help them make it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinsta.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-become-a-web-developer%2F&#x26;via=kinsta&#x26;text=Want+to+work+in+web+development...+but+no+idea+where+to+start%3F+%F0%9F%98%85+This+post+has+the+best+online+learning+platforms%2C+web+development+tools%2C+and+career+info+you%E2%80%99ll+need+%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F&#x26;hashtags=WebDev%2CTechCareers\">Want to work in web development... but no idea where to start? üòÖ This post has the best online learning platforms, web development tools, and career info you‚Äôll need ‚¨áÔ∏èClick to Tweet</a></p>\n<h2>What Does a Web Developer Do?</h2>\n<p>Wondering what exactly your daily tasks are? Here‚Äôs the general job description for a web developer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use code to create websites and prototypes</li>\n<li>Design a visually appealing layout for a website (either from scratch or with the help of a <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/\">web designer</a>)</li>\n<li>Maintain active websites by <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/code-review-tools/\">cleaning up code</a> and debugging errors</li>\n<li>Create a database <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-mysql/\">using SQL</a></li>\n<li>Work with clients to decide on project scope and figure out the fine details of website features and design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are dozens of ways you can specialize, which will change your job description a fair bit. For instance, you could choose to work in frontend or backend technologies, or you could <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/sysadmin/\">become a systems administrator</a> responsible for keeping servers up and running.</p>\n<p>But in general, these are the most basic tasks you‚Äôll be responsible for.</p>\n<h2>Why Become a Web Developer?</h2>\n<p>While it may not be for everyone, web development has a shallow barrier to entry and is one of the most accessible jobs you can pick up. Despite this, it pays reasonably well, and web developers are always in demand.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not to say that the work isn‚Äôt often challenging, but the fundamentals are very quickly self-taught (and many developers like the challenge!).</p>\n<p>Breaking into the ever-growing tech industry is always a good choice long-term. If you‚Äôre willing and able to pursue <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/scripting-languages/\">popular coding languages</a> ‚Äî and in web development, there‚Äôs always a hot new language employers are scrambling to hire for ‚Äî you‚Äôre almost guaranteed a steady job.</p>\n<p>Popular coding languages between 2020‚Äì21</p>\n<p>Finally, web development is a flexible job. Your career may be spent <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/best-tools-for-freelancers/\">doing freelance work</a> or at a <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/developer-roles/development-at-kinsta/\">company with a salary</a>. The tasks you do and the skills or languages you focus on are up to you.</p>\n<p>You‚Äôll need to try out programming before you can say if it‚Äôs right for you, but if you put in the work to try beginner coding and find that it makes sense, then you may make a good web developer.</p>\n<h3>Web Developer Salary and Demand</h3>\n<p>If you‚Äôre considering becoming a web developer, it‚Äôs good to know what sort of salary you can expect and how easy it will be to get a job.</p>\n<p>You can check our write-ups on <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/web-developer-salary/\">the average web developer salary</a>, plus <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/php-developer-salary/\">PHP developers</a> and <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-developer-salary/\">WordPress developers</a>.</p>\n<p>But the consensus is that the average developer makes $60k‚Äì75k/year.</p>\n<p>Average developer base salary in June 2021</p>\n<p>Of course, the pay will depend on your experience level, the languages and technologies you pursue, and whether you freelance or work a steady job. But it‚Äôs a reasonable estimate to start with.</p>\n<p>As for demand, the US Bureau of Labor predicts that <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-6\">demand for web designers and developers will grow 8%</a> from 2019‚Äì29. For reference, that‚Äôs double what most occupations on average are projected to grow.</p>\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics on increases in employment opportunities for web developers</p>\n<p>Some web developer jobs are more competitive than others ‚Äî positions like frontend developer, which are far easier to pick up, may pay less well and be more laborious to find a job for ‚Äî but the outlook is still outstanding.</p>\n<h2>How Hard Is It to Become a Web Developer?</h2>\n<p>Web development is one of the most straightforward jobs to get into ‚Äî if you can figure out programming. Not all jobs are for everyone, and there will be those who may struggle to wrap their heads around code.</p>\n<p>For some people, becoming a web developer will be a breeze. For others, it may never quite click with you. But for most people, a little dedication and a lot of practice will go a long way.</p>\n<p>The process of becoming a web developer is much less convoluted than other jobs, and there are <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular/\">more paths available</a> to get you on the right track. It‚Äôs also a much more flexible, varied job with lots of different specializations. So whatever your learning style or skills you‚Äôre suited for, there‚Äôs something for you.</p>\n<p>Mastering web development will take ongoing work and dedication, and it‚Äôs a job that offers a challenge and requires problem-solving skills. It‚Äôs easy to learn the basics, but expect to encounter frustrating yet solvable problems along the way.</p>\n<h3>Web Development Requirements</h3>\n<p>Curious about what you‚Äôll need to become a web developer? The exact requirements depend on where you‚Äôre specializing. For instance, a backend developer should generally create and edit a database, but you cannot expect the same of a frontend developer.</p>\n<p>In addition, the programming languages and frameworks you know will distinguish you as a specific type of developer.</p>\n<p>Still, here are some skills and knowledge you‚Äôll need, regardless of specialization, before you can call yourself a web developer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proficiency in at least one web language. Depending on your position, you will likely need to learn more.</li>\n<li>Knowledge in other related skills (<a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular/\">web frameworks</a>, libraries, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/git-vs-github/\">Git</a>, etc.).</li>\n<li>Problem-solving skills are required to work with and debug code.</li>\n<li>Attentive to details to stop bugs from happening in the first place.</li>\n<li>Communication and team skills are essential to work with other developers, clients, designers, and testers.</li>\n<li>A degree of independence and being able to problem-solve on your own.</li>\n<li>Self-motivated learning is another necessary skill for success.</li>\n<li>Familiarity with <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/web-development-tools/\">popular web development tools</a> is valuable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Do You Need a Degree to Become a Web Developer?</h3>\n<p>Many jobs request that applicants have an associate‚Äôs degree in computer science or a similar field. Other positions may ask for a bachelor‚Äôs degree or just certification from an online course.</p>\n<p>However, you do not strictly need a college degree to get a job. Experience and a <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/portfolio-website/\">complete portfolio</a> are often far more valuable. More and more job listings are skipping out on requiring a degree and opting to ask for proof of experience.</p>\n<p>As this is a highly technical field with plenty of room for self-teaching, it‚Äôs more important that you know how to do the job than that you‚Äôre certified to do it. That said, a degree will make it simpler from the start.</p>\n<p>Self-taught developers may find difficulty landing their first job with neither experience nor a degree. You‚Äôll likely need to fill your portfolio with self-made projects first or turn to freelance to build up some job history.</p>\n<p>If you don‚Äôt want a formal college degree, online certifications like those offered by coding bootcamps can be a suitable replacement.</p>\n<h3>Types of Web Developers</h3>\n<p>Web development is a highly specialized career. You‚Äôll rarely find a person who describes themselves simply as a ‚Äúweb developer.‚Äù Depending on what you do, which part of the website you focus on, and what technologies you work with, you can choose from a wide array of job titles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frontend developer:</strong> A widespread choice as the skills are easy to pick up, frontend/client-side developers work on the front-facing website. Languages of choice are <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/html-vs-html5/\">HTML</a>, CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap and jQuery are also popular technologies.</li>\n<li><strong>Backend developer:</strong> These developers work with technologies like the server and database. No backend developer is the same, as there are dozens of backend programming languages. Common choices are Java, Ruby, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/php-tutorials/\">PHP</a>, Python, and <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-mysql/\">MySQL</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Full-stack developer:</strong> A combination of frontend and backend developers. They know enough languages to get by on the server and client sides.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the main three, but you can specialize further by becoming a web engineer, security expert, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-developer-salary/\">WordPress developer</a>, mobile web developer, web application developer, and more.</p>\n<h2>Steps to Becoming a Web Developer</h2>\n<p>You can take various paths to become a web developer, and your own experience will present unique challenges. But generally, most web development careers follow a similar form.</p>\n<p>First, you need to choose how you‚Äôll learn development. Will you be going to college? What sort of degree are you pursuing? An associate‚Äôs or bachelor‚Äôs degree related in some way to computer science is best.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre not going to college, will you try to get certified? Certification or not, will you take a paid or free online course? Or are you going all-in to teach yourself using <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/php-tutorials/\">only online resources</a>?</p>\n<p>After you‚Äôve decided that, you‚Äôll need to pick a specialization (frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.). You can put this off as you experiment with different aspects of web development, but you need to choose before pursuing a narrowed study.</p>\n<p>Next, is what <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/best-programming-language-to-learn/\">programming languages</a> and technologies do you want to learn?</p>\n<p>All this may come in a different order. You may choose to specialize or go in already knowing what languages you want to learn and then select a course accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Want to know how we increased our traffic over 1000%?</h3>\n<p>Join 20,000+ others who get our weekly newsletter with insider WordPress tips!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-become-a-web-developer/#newsletter\">Subscribe Now</a></p>\n<p>After you‚Äôve picked up some web development skills, you‚Äôll need to get some projects under your belt for your portfolio.
