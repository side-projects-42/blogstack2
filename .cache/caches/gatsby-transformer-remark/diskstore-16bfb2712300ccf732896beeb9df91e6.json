I use this all. the. time. It's a mandatory extension for our dev team.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks\">Bookmarks</a> - It helps you to navigate in your code, moving between important positions easily and quickly. I use this in conjunction with MetaGo to be almost mouse-free while coding.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=metaseed.metago\">MetaGO</a> - Wicked fast cursor movement/selection for a focus on keyboard usage. This changed how I use VS Code forever. Seriously.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emilast.LogFileHighlighter\">Log File Highlighter</a> - Just as it sounds, gives VSCode .log file support so you can actually read those log dumps without your eyes bleeding.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spywhere.guides\">Guides</a> - Now you don't have to collapse and open all you're freaking elements to figure out nesting. This works really great with Beautify mentioned above and Rainbow Brackets, below.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets\">Rainbow Brackets</a> - Highlights the current bracket-set you're in and colours the rest differently for very easy location identification. If you're a heavy JS developer this is a great extension.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kisstkondoros.vscode-gutter-preview\">Image Preview</a> - Shows an image preview in the gutter and on hover. So key for checking if I just referenced the correct image/icon.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens\">GitLens</a> - One of the most used extensions for sure; Gitlens is a must have for VS Code and just makes the Git experience so much better all around. Pair this with the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore\">.gitignore</a> and <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rafaelmaiolla.diff\">.diff</a> extensions for good coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Faster Coding inside VS Code</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek\">CSS Peek</a> - Inspired by a similar feature in Brackets called CSS Inline Editors. One of my favourite Bracket features now in VS Code.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint\">stylelint</a> - We lint our JS, so why not our LESS/SASS/CSS too? Great for quickly cleaning up sloppy CSS.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass\">Live Sass Compiler</a> - Sure, you got Gulp, Webpack, NPM, Grunt but sometimes you want to compile/transpile your SASS/SCSS files to CSS files in realtime with live browser reload. This does just that.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer\">Live Server</a> - Best local development Server with live reload feature for static &#x26; dynamic pages (even PHP!).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pflannery.vscode-versionlens\">Version Lens</a> - Update dependencies/devDependencies to latest version for specified package.json. Recommended by: <a href=\"https://dev.to/qm3ster\">Mihail</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv\">DotENV</a> - Adds support and highlighting for .env files - something I rely on heavily pushing to Heroku, Netlify, etc...</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pretty Screenshots</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode\">Polacode</a> - Highlight code, snap a really nice screenshot with your code theme's colours. Great for tutorials or documentation and you want to provide code examples.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Multiple Instances of VS Code</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync\">Settings Sync</a> - Uses a private gist to save a setting file so you can sync Settings, Snippets, Themes, File Icons, Launch, Keybindings, Workspaces and Extensions between multiple VS Code instances. I use this to keep my Laptop, Work Desktop and Home Desktop all in sync with two simple commands.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig\">EditorConfig</a> - Override user/workspace settings with settings found in .editorconfig files. I use this to enforce specific rules for the development team on a per-project basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So there you have it, while I have lots of other plugins more specific to the environments I use (Front-End Web + Azure Cloud) hopefully you'll find these extensions useful in your daily use of VS Code!</p>\n<p>Let me know if you already use them and if you love or hate them. Or, some extensions I might have missed and should try out!</p>\n<h3>Noteworthy Mentions</h3>\n<p>After getting some feedback in the comments of you guys showing me some of your favourite VS Code extensions here are some new ones that I think are solid enough to also include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost\">Import Cost</a> - Shows the filesize cost of importing. - Recommended by: <a href=\"https://dev.to/miku86\">miku86</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stuart.unique-window-colors\">Window Colors</a> - Run multiple instances of VS Code? Have each window uniquely coloured so you don't lose track of which project is in what window. - Recommended by: <a href=\"https://dev.to/jefrypozo\">Jefry Pozo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode\">Prettier</a> - Very \"Pretty\" markup cleaner. Used by Stackoverflow to display nice code snippits. But, doesn't handle HTML inside <code>.js/.ejs/.jade/.pug</code> templates so not the best if working with many static site generators.</li>\n</ul>\n<!--EndFragment-->"}
